### Welcome!

I am **Ashutosh Jha**, a Quantitative Data Scientist based in Tübingen, Germany.

An engineer at heart, I specialize in the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Financial Economics**. I leverage a strong foundation in software development to build rigorous, data-driven solutions, with a particular focus on the **finance** and **energy** industries.

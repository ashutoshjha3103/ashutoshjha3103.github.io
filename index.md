### Welcome!

I am **Ashutosh Jha**, a Quantitative Data Scientist based in Tübingen, Germany.

An engineer at heart, I specialize in the intersection of **Quantitative Methods**, **Machine Learning** and **Financial Economics**. I leverage a strong foundation in software development to build rigorous, data-driven solutions and research training in my masters degree to further my research objectives.

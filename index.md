### Welcome!

I am **Ashutosh Jha**, a Quantitative Data Scientist and Engineer based in Tübingen, Germany.

An engineer at heart, I specialize in the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Financial Economics**. I leverage a strong foundation in software development to build rigorous, data-driven solutions, with a particular focus on the **finance** and **energy** industries.

My academic and research work centers on **Financial Engineering** and **Stochastic Processes**. I utilize advanced **Asset Pricing** frameworks and statistical modeling to value complex financial instruments and analyze market dynamics—bridging the gap between theoretical finance and computational implementation.

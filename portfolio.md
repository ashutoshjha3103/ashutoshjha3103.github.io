### Academic & Technical Projects

**Master Thesis: Optimal Transport in Linear Independent Component Analysis**
*Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (Empirical Inference)*
*Supervisors: Dr. Simon Buchholz, Prof. Dr. Michel Besserve, Prof. Dr. Joachim Grammig*
Research focused on applying optimal transport theory to solve problems in linear independent component analysis (ICA).

**Design, Pricing, and Hedging of a Structured Product (Bonus Certificate)**
*Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Financial Engineering)* | *Feb 2025 – May 2025*
This project focuses on the design, pricing, and hedging of a Bonus Certificate linked to Costco (COST) stock, targeting investors with a moderately bullish or range-bound outlook. The product is priced using the Bates model, which captures market dynamics with jumps and stochastic volatility. A two-stage calibration and Monte Carlo simulation are used to estimate and price the path-dependent payoff. The full methodology covers everything from data preparation to exotic valuation and risk management.

**Probabilistic Asset Pricing**
*University of Tübingen (Master Seminar on Econometrics)* | *Nov 2024 – Jan 2025*
*Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Joachim Grammig*
This project explored a Bayesian framework for estimating stock risk premia, developed by integrating theoretical insights with machine learning techniques. The approach builds on the hybrid model of Grammig et al. (2024) and incorporates forward-looking measures derived from Martin and Wagner (2019). Key financial indicators—such as liquidity, book-to-market ratio, momentum, and macroeconomic variables—were included alongside a latent variable to capture unobservable effects. Estimation was carried out using Kalman filtering and the EM algorithm, with validation performed on simulated financial data.

**Empirical Asset Pricing: CBM and UCCAPM**
*University of Tübingen* | *Apr 2024 – July 2024*
This project compares the Consumption-Based Model (CBM) and the Ultimate Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model (UCCAPM) in pricing 25 Fama-French portfolios. The analysis evaluates the performance of the CBM, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and investigates whether accounting for ultimate consumption risk (as in the UCCAPM) improves explanatory power by capturing the lagged adjustment of consumption to wealth changes.

**Parameter Estimation for ARMA(1,1) Processes**
*University of Tübingen (Advanced Time Series Analysis)* | *Jan 2025*
This project presents a detailed analysis of parameter estimation for an ARMA(1,1) process using Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) and Quasi Maximum Likelihood (QML). It includes simulation studies to test stationarity assumptions, compare the efficiency and robustness of both estimation methods, and analyze the stochastic properties of the resulting confidence intervals.

**Ripple Down Rules (RDR) Simulation**
*BITS Pilani, Goa Campus (APPCAIR Lab)*
*Supervisor: Prof. Ashwin Srinivasan*
Ripple Down Rules (RDR) offer a tree-based, incremental approach to building rule-based classifiers, allowing systems to be updated without disrupting past performance. In this project, a Python script was implemented to simulate RDR: cases enter at the root and follow a path of rules, each with conditions and classifications, optionally passing to exception nodes. If no rule matches, the user can add a new one or accept the parent’s classification.
